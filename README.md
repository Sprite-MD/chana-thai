# chana-thai

Freelance web developing for a thai restaurant. Programmed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build experience. Implemented a single-page application as a design choice, using fetching API to work with external JSON files.  
No frameworks were used to build a better understanding of web development. May revisit and update project with React and bootstrap/tailwind frameworks.  


Features:  
A fixed navbar at the top of the page that follows the user when they scroll down the page.  
Hero page  
A menu with selectable categories at the top that expands into several menu cards  
Gallery of pictures that open into a lightbox when clicked  


To-do:  
Fix pricing for certain categories with more than one price  
Add additional descriptions to certain categories  
add side arrows to menu section so that users have alternate methods of menu traversal  
style the menu buttons to be more appealing  
add another row in about section so it isn't too small(?)  
adjust modal spacings and the arrows  
switch out pictures for actual restarant pics
