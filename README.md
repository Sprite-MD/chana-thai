# chana-thai

Freelance web developing for a thai restaurant. Programmed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build experience. Implemented a single-page application as a design choice, using fetching API to work with external JSON files.  
In order to develop a solid foundation on how JavaScript works, no frameworks were used. May revisit and update project with React and bootstrap/tailwind.  


Features:  
A fixed navbar at the top of the page that follows the user when they scroll down the page.  
Hero page  
A menu with selectable categories at the top that expands into several menu cards  
Gallery of pictures that open into a lightbox when clicked  


To-do:  
Style menu items, category descriptions, modal arrows, & menu buttons  
Add another row in about section so it isn't too small(?)  
Create modal click out when clicking outside of slide  
Switch out pictures for actual restarant pics  
Adjust size changes for different aspect ratios including laptops and mobile
